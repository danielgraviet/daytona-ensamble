You are an expert Python programmer.

Your task is to write a correct implementation of the following function.
Follow the variant instructions carefully.

# Problem Description
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

# Requirements
- You must implement the function described above.
- Use the function signature exactly as provided.
- Do NOT change parameter names or types.
- Do NOT include any test code.
- Do NOT include print statements.
- Do NOT include extra text outside the python code block.
- Only return the function implementation.
- The final answer MUST be wrapped in a Python code fence like:

# Variant Instructions
Write the simplest correct implementation using clear Python. Use a direct, standard approach without unnecessary optimization. Return only the function implementation wrapped in Python code fences like:
```python
<your code here>
```

# Output Format
Return ONLY one python code block with the function implementation.
Do not include explanations, comments (unless allowed by variant), or any text outside the code block.
